      <tagdesc>References an external job management file for a job process in which the document is being used. Use of job names is under user control. Typical use would be to identify all documents that are part of a particular job or contract. There are multiple values because there can be more than one job using a particular document at any time, and it can also be useful to keep historical information about what jobs a document was part of previously.</tagdesc>
