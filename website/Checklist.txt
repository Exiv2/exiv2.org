Release checklist
-----------------

Caution: Updating the website can be 1 week's work!
         You might get lucky and do it quicker
         You should assume it'll take time to find and fix everything
         You should publish the website (on another server) and ask the team to review
         Many scripts are provided, however this is not a "push button" operation.

1 month before the release: Update po/ directory, notify translators
