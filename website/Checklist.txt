Release checklist
-----------------
$ export EXIV2HOME=~/gnu/github/exiv2/exiv2
$ export EXIV2WEB=~/gnu/exiv2/team/website

Caution: Updating the website can be two or three days work to be certain everything is good.
         You should publish the website (on another server) and ask the team to review
         Many scripts are provided, however this is not a "push button" operation.

         For a 'dot' release, it only requires:
         1 Update the version on the website (echo -e '0.27.0.1' > var/__version__)
         2 make get-latest                                 # get "Latest" builds from Jenkins
         3 pushd bin ; make rssdate ; popd                 # make sure rssdate is built
         4 pushd ${EXIV2HOME}/doc/templates ; make ; popd  # create Exif.xml, Iptc.xml etc
         5 make update                                     # makes Exiv2.pdf and runs Doxygwen
         6 make                                            #
         7 make publish                                    # copies the web to ~/Jenkins/website/html/

Process
-------
1 month before the release: Update po/ directory, notify translators
2 weeks before the release: Update po/ directory, remind translators
Update po/ directory

Update version in $EXIV2HOME/CMakeLists.txt
Get Jenkins to build 'master' (for v0.27.0.1, I build on branch 'RC1')
Check the build logs on Jenkins

Update the Version on the website
$ cd $EXIV2WEB
$ echo -e '0.27.0.1' > var/__version__

Run the script to get revision history:
$ cd $EXIV2WEB/../contrib/redmine
$ ./progress.py getdata.sh release
Modify/paste output to html/var/__ChangeLog__
$ ./progress.py getdata.sh release console
Modify/paste output to doc/ChangeLog

GitHub update for v0.27 and later (might be automagic, don't know yet)

Update var/__ChangeLog__ and doc/ChangeLog

Review and update webpages
	News page             master/news.xml
	Download page         master/download.html.in
	Archive page          master/archive.html.in
	Index page            master/index.html.in
	Other pages as needed
Review and update documentation
	API doc intro
	Taglists
	Update READMEs (I use MacDown) html/README.html and html/README-CONAN.html

Copy the builds from the webserver to the website:
	$ cd $EXIV2WEB
    $ make get-latest

	Get the Website ready:
	$ cd $EXIV2WEB
	$ make update
	$ make
	$ open html/index.html

	Validate uploaded webpages with W3C HTML checker

	Copy the html/ directory to the webserver.
