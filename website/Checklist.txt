Release checklist
-----------------
$ export EXIV2HOME=~/gnu/github/exiv2/exiv2
$ export EXIV2WEB=~/gnu/exiv2/team/website

Caution: Updating the website can be two or three days work to be certain everything is good.
         You should publish the website (on another server) and ask the team to review
         Many scripts are provided, however this is not a "push button" operation.

         For a 'dot' release, it only requires:
         1 Update the version on the website
         2 make get-latest
         3 make
         4 make publish

1 month before the release: Update po/ directory, notify translators
2 weeks before the release: Update po/ directory, remind translators
Update po/ directory

Update version in $EXIV2HOME/CMakeLists.txt
Get Jenkins to build 'master' (for v0.27.0.1, I build on branch 'RC1')
Check the build logs on Jenkins

Prepare the tags and docs
-------------------------
$ cd $EXIV2HOME
$ bin/tagtables.sh
$ bin/samples.sh          # uses $EXIV2HOME/build
$ make doc

Redmine updates for v0.27
-------------------------

Run the script to get revision history:
$ cd $EXIV2WEB/../contrib/redmine
$ ./progress.py getdata.sh release
Modify/paste output to html/var/__ChangeLog__
$ ./progress.py getdata.sh release console
Modify/paste output to doc/ChangeLog

GitHub update for v0.27 and later (might be automagic, don't know yet)

Update the Version on the website
$ cd $EXIV2WEB
$ echo -e '0.27.0.1' > var/__version__
Update var/__ChangeLog__ and doc/ChangeLog

Review and update webpages
	News page             master/news.xml
	Download page         master/download.html.in
	Archive page          master/archive.html.in
	Index page            master/index.html.in
	Other pages as needed
Review and update documentation
	API doc intro
	Taglists
	Update READMEs (I use MacDown) html/README.html and html/README-CONAN.html

Copy the builds from the webserver to the website:
	$ cd $EXIV2WEB
    $ make get-latest

	Get the Website ready:
	$ cd $EXIV2WEB
	$ make
	$ open html/index.html
	You might want to "tweak" man page.   diff html/manpage html/manpage-v27.html

	Validate uploaded webpages with W3C HTML checker

	Copy the html/ directory to the webserver.
	$ make publish

When you're sure it's good, tell the world
